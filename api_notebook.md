{{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_full}} is deprecated. As of 18 February 2024 you can't create new instances, and access to free instances will be removed. Existing Standard plan instances are supported until 18 January 2025. Any instances that still exist on that date will be deleted.

To get you started with the {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery}} API, the [Using {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_notm}} Jupyter Notebook](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/exchange/public/entry/view/e82c765fd1165439caccfc4ce8579a25?context=cpdaas) demonstrates an end-to-end cycle. It starts with setting up libraries and configuring {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}}, all the way to visualizing results by using PixieDust.
