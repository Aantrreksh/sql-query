# Setup and analysis

[Analyzing Data with IBM Cloud SQL Query](https://medium.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/analyzing-data-with-ibm-cloud-sql-query-bc53566a59f5) 
shows you how to set up and start using {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_full}} from the UI, as well as an example using ibmcloudsql to query traffic accident data 
stored in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}}, and then visualize accidents in a Jupyter Notebook with PixieDust.
