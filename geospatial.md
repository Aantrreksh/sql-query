# Geospatial analytics

Geospatial SQL functions allow developers to efficiently index and perform calculations on geospatial data. 
The combination of geospatial analytic functions with the serverless form factor of SQL Query makes it very easy to build location analytics solutions with your data in the cloud.

The guide [Getting Started with SQL Query Geospatial](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/data/wiki/Getting-Started-with-SQL-Query-Geospatial) 
shows you how to use SQL Query to analyze geospatial data.

The guide [FordGo bike analysis using SQL Query](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/data/wiki/FordGo-bike-analysis-using-SQL-Query) demonstrates how to use SQL Query's geospatial
capabilites to analyze bike-share data from San Francisco.
