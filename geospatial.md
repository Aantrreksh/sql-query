# Geospatial Analytics

Geospatial SQL functions allow developers to efficiently index and perform calculations on geospatial data. 
The combination of geospatial analytic functions with the serverless form factor of {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_full}} makes it very easy 
to build location analytics solutions with your data in the cloud.

[Getting Started with SQL Query Geospatial](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/data/wiki/Getting-Started-with-SQL-Query-Geospatial) 
shows you how to use {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}} to analyze geospatial data.

[FordGo bike analysis using SQL Query](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/data/wiki/FordGo-bike-analysis-using-SQL-Query) demonstrates 
how to use {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}}'s geospatial capabilites to analyze bike-share data from San Francisco.

[Querying geospatial data using IBM SQL Query](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2018/07/querying-geospatial-data-using-ibm-sql-query/) 
shows you how to create and run geospatial queries with {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}} on bicycle location data stored in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}} 
using IBMÂ® Watson Studio and PixieDust.

Learn how to deploy micro-service applications, store data generated by those micro-services in IBM Cloud Object Storage, 
and then query that data using {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}}:
