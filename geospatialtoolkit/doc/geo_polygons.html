            <p class="shortdesc">The Geospatial Toolkit functions use polygons that are formed by non-self-intersecting
               exterior and interior rings. A polygon can encompass an area of any size, including large areas such
               as the Pacific Ocean, the Polar Ice Cap, the Southern Hemisphere, and the United States.
            </p>
            
            <div class="section">
               <p class="p">On an infinite plane, a non-self-intersecting ring divides the plane into two regions: one with
                  finite area and another with an infinite area. The planar polygon is the region with finite area.
                  However, on a closed manifold such as an ellipsoid or spheroid, a non self-intersecting ring divides
                  the surface into two regions, both of which have finite areas. The orientation of the ring
                  determines which of the two regions is contained by the polygon.
               </p>
               
               
               <p class="p">Each ring is oriented according to the left-hand rule. Consider an imaginary person walking along
                  the ring: the area to the left of this person is inside the polygon, whereas the area to the right
                  of this person is outside the polygon. The polygon and orientedPolygon functions, which are in the
                  com.ibm.streams.geospatial.ext namespace, can assist you in constructing polygons that follow this
                  format.
