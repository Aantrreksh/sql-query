Use time series functions to process time series data.

-   [Artifact creation functions](/docs/services/sql-query?topic=sql-query-artifact)  
    Each of these functions produces, as its output, a time series or some other artifact that some data processing functions require as     input.
-   [Data processing functions](/docs/services/sql-query?topic=sql-query-data_processing_functions)  
    Each of these functions evaluates or manipulates input data and produces output data.
