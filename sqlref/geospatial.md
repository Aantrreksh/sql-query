The [Geospatial Toolkit](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSCJDQ/com.ibm.swg.im.dashdb.analytics.doc/doc/geo_intro.html) provides a set of [geospatial functions](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSCJDQ/com.ibm.swg.im.dashdb.analytics.doc/doc/geo_functions.html) that you can use to efficiently process and index spatial data.
