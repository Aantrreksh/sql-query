## Interpolator creation functions
{: #interpolator_creation}

**TS_INTERPOLATOR_FILL(see below<sup>2</sup>)**
Output: InterpolatorType
Creates an interpolator that replaces any null value with the specified value.

**TS_INTERPOLATOR_NEAREST(see below<sup>2</sup>)**
Output: InterpolatorType
Creates an interpolator that replaces a null value with the value of the neighboring observation that has the nearest timetick. If the value of that observation is also null, the original null value remains unchanged. If the previous and next timeticks are equidistant, the value of the observation with the previous timetick is used. If no nearest observation exists (that is, if the input time series contains a single observation), this function replaces the null value with the specified value.

**TS_INTERPOLATOR_NEXT(see below<sup>2</sup>)**
Output: InterpolatorType
Creates an interpolator that replaces a null value with the next value in the time series. If no such value exists, it fills the null value with the specified value.

**TS_INTERPOLATOR_PREV(see below<sup>2</sup>)**
Output: InterpolatorType
Creates an interpolator that replaces a null value with the previous value. If there is no previous value, it fills the null value with the specified value.

**TS_INTERPOLATOR_LINEAR(see below<sup>2</sup>, Integer, Integer)**

Creates an interpolator that replaces a null value with a value that is calculated by [linear interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation) based on the specified number of previous (second parameter) and subsequent (third parameter) observations (both numbers must be positive). The value of the first parameter is used as a filler value when there are not enough previous or subsequent values to satisfy parameter 2 or 3. For example, if `TS_INTERPOLATOR_LINEAR(9.76, 3, 5)` is specified, for each null value, a line is calculated using the 3 previous and 5 subsequent data points that minimizes the average error for all 8 data points, and the point on this line that corresponds to the timetick of the null value determines the filler value. If 3 previous or 5 subsequent data points are not available, the value 9.76 is used as the filler value.

**TS_INTERPOLATOR_SPLINE(see below<sup>2</sup>, Integer, Integer)**
Output: InterpolatorType
Creates an interpolator that replaces a null value with a value that is calculated by [spline interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_interpolation) based on the specified number of previous (second parameter) and subsequent (third parameter) observations (both numbers must be positive). The value of the first parameter is used as a filler value when there are not enough previous or subsequent values to satisfy parameter 2 or 3. For example, if `TS_INTERPOLATOR_SPLINE(3, 5, 9.76)` is specified, for each null value, a spline is calculated using the 3 previous and 5 subsequent data points that minimizes the average error for all 8 data points, and the point on this spline that corresponds to the timetick of the null value determines the filler value. If 3 previous or 5 subsequent data points are not available, the value 9.76 is used as the filler value.

**<sup>2</sup> The input type can be any of String, Double, Array[String], Array[Double], but must be of a type that corresponds to the type of the time series.**

The matching function specifies a matcher, a pattern, and the time series to which the pattern is to be compared.

**TS_MATCHER_SEQ()**
Output: MatcherType
Creates a matcher that matches an array of string values (the *pattern*) with an entire string time series exactly and in sequence. If the pattern and time series match, the function that uses the matcher returns the input time series; otherwise, the function returns null.

**TS_MATCHER_SUBLIST(Double)**
Output: MatcherType
Creates a matcher that matches an array of string values (the *pattern*) with a sublist of a string time series, to within the specified coverage threshold. The threshold is a double-precision number in the range 0.0 - 1.0 that indicates the minimum ratio of pattern size to sublist. For example, a threshold of 0.75 means that the specified pattern must match at least 75% of the time series values, in sequence and contiguously. If the threshold is met, the pattern is considered to have matched, and the function that uses the matcher returns the observations that correspond to the pattern; otherwise, the function returns null.

For example, a threshold of 0.75 means that the specified pattern must match at least 75% of the sequence of time series values, in sequence but not necessarily contiguously. If the threshold is met, the pattern is considered to have matched, and the function that uses the matcher returns the observations that correspond to the pattern; otherwise, the function returns null.

**TS_MATCHER_SUBSEQ_PM(Double)**
Output: MatcherType
Creates a matcher that matches an array of string values (the *pattern*) with a sub-sequence of a string time series, to within the specified coverage threshold.

For example, a threshold of 0.75 means that the specified pattern must match at least 75% of the match string, in sequence but not necessarily contiguously. If the threshold is met, the pattern is considered to have matched, and the function that uses the matcher returns the observations that correspond to the pattern; otherwise, the function returns null.

**TS_MATCHER_SUBSEQ_MS(Double)**
Output: MatcherType
Creates a matcher that matches an array of string values (the *pattern*) with a sub-sequence of a string time series, to within the specified coverage threshold. The threshold is a double-precision number in the range 0.0 - 1.0 that indicates the minimum ratio of match string size to sequence size. For example, a threshold of 0.75 means that the specified pattern must match at least 75% of the sequence of time series values. If the threshold is met, the pattern is considered to have matched the sub-sequence and the function that uses the matcher returns the observations that correspond to the match string; otherwise, the function returns null.

**TS_MATCHER_SUBSET_PS(Double)**
Output: MatcherType
Creates a matcher that matches an array of string values (the *pattern*) with a string time series, regardless of the order in which the items in the pattern occur in the time series. The specified coverage threshold is a double-precision number in the range 0.0 - 1.0 that indicates the minimum ratio of pattern size to sequence size. For example, a threshold of 0.75 means that the specified pattern must match at least 75% of the sequence of time series values. If the threshold is met, the pattern is considered to have matched, and the function that uses the matcher returns the observations that correspond to the pattern; otherwise, the function returns null.

**TS_MATCHER_SUBSET_PM(Double)**
Output: MatcherType
Creates a matcher that matches an array of string values (the *pattern*) with a string time series, regardless of the order in which the items in the pattern occur in the time series. The specified coverage threshold is a double-precision number in the range 0.0 - 1.0 that indicates the minimum ratio of pattern size to match string size. For example, a threshold of 0.75 means that the specified pattern must match at least 75% of the match string, in sequence but not necessarily contiguously. If the threshold is met, the pattern is considered to have matched, and the function that uses the matcher returns the observations that correspond to the pattern; otherwise, the function returns null.

**TS_MATCHER_SUBSET_MS(Double)**
Output: MatcherType
Creates a matcher that matches an array of string values (the *pattern*) with a string time series, regardless of the order in which the items in the pattern occur in the time series.
