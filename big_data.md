Planning your data model and distribution of your data in {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}} can lead to increased performance and lower costs. The article [How to lay out Big Data in IBM Cloud Object Storage for Spark SQL](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/big-data-layout) shares tricks of the trade to impact cost and performance of your SQL queries.

In {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}} you can specify the format and layout in which a result for an SQL query is written. By adding these abilities, {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_full}} opens up serverless data transformation in Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_short}}.
