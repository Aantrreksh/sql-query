# Disaster recovery and backup
{: #disaster}

{{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_full}} stores information about the submitted jobs, such as the SQL statement, the status of the job, or the job ID. Backups are performed on a regular basis, therefore, in case of a disaster, you can lose information of the last eight ours at the most. The job results are stored in IBMÂ® Cloud Object Storage and are independent of any SQL Query disaster recovery.

If you want to store information of {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}} jobs outside of {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}}, to be able to have a larger job history available, you can do so in the {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}} Python SDK *export_job_history(cos_url)*. It stores all new queries in the specified Cloud {{site.data.keyword.cos_full}} path in Parquet format.
