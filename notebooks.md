Jupyter Notebooks are web-based environments for interactive computing. You can run small pieces of code that process your data, and you can immediately view the results of your computation. Notebooks include all of the building blocks you need to work with data.

Check out the following notebooks to get familiar with {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_full}}:

- Learn how to use the {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}} API to run SQL statements in a programmatic way for data analytics and ETL, by using the ibmcloudsql Python library in [Using {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_notm}}](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/656c7d43-7ccd-4e50-a3c0-bbc37c001132/view?access_token=baaa77ad715e17a8f823615d45431329fde0fe92fecb85abb9fc55a877939fe8). The notebook also demonstrates the library features and how to combine {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}} with visualization libraries, such as PixieDust. 

- Learn how to combine {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}} with visualization libraries, such as PixieDust, folium, or matplotlib to explore particulate matter data in [Explore particulate matter data by using {{site.data.keyword.sqlquery_short}}](https://eu-gb.dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/exchange/public/entry/view/5d686c16d14491f4c3997b67fe11506d).
